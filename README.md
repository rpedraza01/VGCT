## Video Game Collection Tool

This project uses the IGDB API to pull video game information to add to a users profile/video game collection.
We will be using Vue.js for the front end and for calling the API. We will be using Django as the back end and PostgreSQL for the database.

It will allow users to search and sort by the following categories:
- Console/platform
- Genre
- Release date (year)
- Publisher/studio
- Game name/title
- Franchise/series
- Covers/artwork
- URL links to official website and/or IGDB's game profile page
- Links to Twitch streams of the game(?)
